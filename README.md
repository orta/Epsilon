# Epsilon

Epsilon is an iPad app for running a web-browser in a fair. It's a webview-wrapper lets you set a key URL, then when the device has been idle for a while it goes back to it. It also lets you browse one navigation stack deep ( so you can click a NYTimes link in an article, but not go to another. ) and will offer to revert to the original URL. 

Nothing too fancy.
